## Troubleshooting GitHub Pages

### 1. **Check the Access Address**
- Make sure you're using the correct address:
  ```
  https://unipixel0810.github.io/mbgi/
  ```
  (Be careful with case sensitivity and spelling!)

### 2. **If You See 404 Not Found**
- The **index.html** file must be in the root of your repository.
- Double-check that the filename is **index.html** and there are no typos in the extension.

### 3. **If Commits/Pushes Are Missing**
- If you haven't pushed your local files to GitHub, the site won't be visible.
- Run the following commands to push again:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
  git push
  ```

### 4. **Build/Deployment Time**
- GitHub Pages may take up to **5 minutes** to set up.
- Try refreshing the page (F5) after a short wait.

### 5. **Check for Error Messages**
- Check the Pages section in Settings for any **red error messages**.
- If there are errors, please let me know so I can help more accurately.

### 6. **Folder Structure Example**
Your folder structure should look like this:

```
mbgi/
  ├── index.html
  └── README.md
```

### If None of the Above Work
- **If you can, please share a screenshot of what you're seeing** (e.g., 404, blank screen) so I can help more accurately.
- It would also be helpful if you could share the file structure (tree) of your repository.

I'll do my best to help you quickly! Please provide any additional information you have.
